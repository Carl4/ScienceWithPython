-------

### Docs in the [Repo](https://github.com/profjsb/ScienceWithPython) ###

   * **doscience.py**: cheeky psuedocode showing how to do groundbreaking science with Python.  __Excercise__ (only try this at home): try to make this object oriented and account for vast number of PI committee meetings.
   
   * **talk slides**: [permalink](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5a1pg0o3z6dlruc/scipy2012_blooom.pdf) (PDF)
   
   * Loads of [Links](http://profjsb.github.com/ScienceWithPython/) to projects and codes that I talked about in the keynote.
